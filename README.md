## ‚ú® About The Project

Tired of endlessly searching for recipes that fit your specific diet and goals? The AI Culinary Journal is your personal AI chef. It transforms your nutritional profile‚Äîincluding dietary style, allergies, health objectives, and favorite cuisines‚Äîinto a beautifully formatted, ready-to-use digital cookbook.

Built with Python and Streamlit, this application runs entirely on your local machine, ensuring your health data remains 100% private. By using **Ollama** to serve a powerful open-source model like **Mistral**, we get all the benefits of generative AI with zero API costs and no rate limits.

### ‚úÖ Key Features

-   **Truly Personalized:** Generates unique cookbooks based on your diet (Vegan, Keto, etc.), allergies, health goals (Weight Loss, Muscle Gain), and food preferences.
-   **100% Private:** Runs completely locally using Ollama. Your personal data never leaves your computer.
-   **Zero Cost:** No need for expensive API keys. The entire stack is built on free, open-source technology.
-   **Elegant UI:** A beautiful, responsive interface inspired by a rustic culinary journal, making meal planning a delightful experience.
-   **Instant & Downloadable:** Get a complete cookbook in seconds and download it as a `.txt` file for offline use.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Python** (version 3.8 or higher)
2.  **Git**
3.  **Ollama**: This is the most important part. Download and install it from the official website:
    -   [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal and clone this GitHub repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-cookbook-app.git
    cd ai-cookbook-app
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    It's best practice to keep project dependencies isolated.
    -   **On macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    -   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies**
    Install all the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Download and Run the AI Model with Ollama**
    Open a **new, separate terminal window** and run the following command. This will download the Mistral model (a few GBs) and start the local AI server.
    ```bash
    ollama run mistral
    ```
    **Leave this terminal window open!** It is now your AI server.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Use

With the setup complete, you can now run the application.

1.  Make sure your Ollama terminal from the previous step is still running.
2.  In your first terminal (with the virtual environment activated), run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3.  Your web browser will automatically open a new tab with the application.
4.  Fill in your preferences in the form.
5.  Click the "Compose My Cookbook" button and watch the magic happen!
